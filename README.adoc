My {ESPHome} configuration for all my ESPHome devices.

== Usage

. Clone the repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone git@github.com:jwillikers/esphome-config.git
----

. Copy the `secrets.yaml.template` template to `secrets.yaml` in the ESPHome configuration directory.

. Add your WiFi SSID and password to the `secrets.yaml` file.
In addition to these, each device should have it's own password for OTA updates and the fallback WiFi hotspot.
Each device also requires a pre-shared encryption key for communicating securely with the Home Assistant API.
See the https://esphome.io/components/api.html#configuration-variables[Native API - for each device Configuration Variables] section of the ESPHome documentation for details.
Home Assistant will prompt you for the device's key once the device has been updated.
+
[,sh]
----
cp esphome/secrets.yaml.template esphome/secrets.yaml
----

. Copy the contents of the `esphome` directory to your ESPHome configuration directory.
